Hello there! This is the latest version of the event management app **Celebr8** (CelebrEight/Celebrate - you got it?)

_“Leave planning to us, have fun(please, don’t get too drunk)”_

Managing parties is hard (you either know that or have to believe me).



**Before:**
Create a chat, send a message with event information, try editing things, invite people, tag people, calculate all the costs yourself, and many other actions that you as an organizer must do...

And you don’t want all of that in your life!

**Now:**

A couple of clicks to create a party,
And just one link to join.

Isn't it wonderful?😻😻😻



_You can try the app yourself._

(Instructions for installation and deployment are coming soon...)

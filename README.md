Hello there! This is the latest version of an event management app called **Celebr8** (CelebrAte - got it?).

_“Leave planning to us, have fun(please, don’t get too drunk)”_

Managing parties is hard (you either know that or have to believe me).



**Before:**
Create a chat, send a message with event information, and then try editing things. After that, invite people, tag people, calculate all the costs yourself, and many more actions to do.

And you don’t want all of that in your life!

**Now:**

A couple of clicks to create a party,
And just one link to join.

Isn't it just wonderful?😻

**_YES Please!_**

You can try the app yourself.

(Instructions for installation and deployment are coming soon... I guess)

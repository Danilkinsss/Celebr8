Hello there! This is the latest version of an event management app called Celebr8.

_“Leave planning to us, have fun(don’t get too drunk)”_

Managing parties is hard (you either know that or have to believe me).

**Before:**
Create a chat, send a message with event information, and then try editing things, after that invite people, tag people, calculate costs yourself...

You don’t want all of that in your life!

**Now:**

A couple of clicks to create a party,
And just one link to join

**_YES Please!_**

You can try the app yourself if you want.

(Instructions for installation and deployment are coming soon...)
